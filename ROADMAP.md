# Geo Utils Roadmap

## Overview

Geo Utils is a geospatial toolkit that provides accurate calculations and data transformations powered by PostGIS. This roadmap outlines our current priorities and future plans.

## Current Status

- ‚úÖ Distance calculations between points
- ‚úÖ Multiple unit support (meters, kilometers, miles, feet)
- ‚úÖ TypeScript support with full type definitions
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive error handling and validation

## In Progress üöß

- Fixing test failures and improving error display

## Coming Soon ‚è≥

### GeoJSON Layer Generation (v0.2.0)

- Generate GeoJSON FeatureCollections from PostGIS data
- Support for custom queries and table-based data
- Perfect for mapping applications and data visualization
- Example use case: Generate map layers for location data with properties

### Vector Tile Generation (v0.3.0)

- Generate Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVT) from PostGIS data
- Support for both on-the-fly and DB-backed generation
- Ideal for high-performance web mapping
- Includes caching and dataset management

### API Improvements (v0.1.5)

- Basic API versioning
- Rate limiting for abuse protection
- Enhanced documentation and examples

## Future Plans üîÆ

- Additional geospatial functions (Area, Bearing, etc.)
- Enhanced documentation and examples
- Performance optimizations
- Community feedback and feature requests
